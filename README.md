This repository contains the datasets used in the recommendation engine.
The description of .csv files is as follows:
movie_dataset.csv file contains fields with details about cast, directors, title, keywords, average votes etc. concerned with each movie. All of the details are present within a single file. This file generates cosine similarity among movies based on 'cast', 'directors', 'keywords' and 'genres' in python.

The remaining .csv files are used to retrive the necessary information for the proper functioning of the final version.
